# GoalContext Migration - Phase A Summary

## Completed: ✅

Phase A of the GoalContext migration has been successfully implemented. This phase focused on high-impact, low-risk components in the goal-details system.

## What Was Created

### 1. GoalContext Infrastructure

**File:** `apps/webapp/src/contexts/GoalContext.tsx`

- Created `GoalProvider` component to wrap goal-scoped UI
- Created `useGoalContext()` hook for required context access
- Created `useOptionalGoalContext()` hook for backward compatibility during migration
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all APIs

## What Was Migrated

### 2. Core Task Item Components

#### DailyGoalTaskItem

**File:** `apps/webapp/src/components/organisms/DailyGoalTaskItem.tsx`

- ✅ Now uses `useGoalContext()` to get goal from context
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with `goal` prop (deprecated)
- ✅ Removed `goal` prop from `GoalDetailsPopover` child call
- ✅ Zero breaking changes - supports both context and prop patterns

#### WeeklyGoalTaskItem

**File:** `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/day-of-week/components/WeeklyGoalTaskItem.tsx`

- ✅ Now uses `useGoalContext()` to get goal from context
- ✅ Uses `useGoalActionsContext()` to get actions from context
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with both `goal` and `onUpdateGoal` props (deprecated)
- ✅ Removed `goal` prop from `GoalDetailsPopover` child call

### 3. Goal Details Modal Components

#### GoalDetailsPopover

**File:** `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/goal-details/GoalDetailsPopover.tsx`

- ✅ Now uses `useOptionalGoalContext()` for flexible context access
- ✅ Wraps content with `GoalProvider` if goal came from prop (backward compat)
- ✅ If already in context, skips redundant provider wrapping
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with `goal` prop (deprecated)

#### GoalDetailsFullScreenModal

**File:** `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/goal-details/GoalDetailsFullScreenModal.tsx`

- ✅ Now uses `useOptionalGoalContext()` for flexible context access
- ✅ Wraps content with `GoalProvider` if goal came from prop (backward compat)
- ✅ If already in context, skips redundant provider wrapping
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with `goal` prop (deprecated)

#### GoalActionMenu

**File:** `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/goal-details/GoalActionMenu.tsx`

- ✅ Now uses `useOptionalGoalContext()` to get goal from context
- ✅ Removed `goal` prop from `GoalDetailsFullScreenModal` child call
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with `goal` prop (deprecated)

#### GoalDetailsChildrenList

**File:** `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/goal-details/GoalDetailsChildrenList.tsx`

- ✅ Wraps each child goal with `GoalProvider`
- ✅ Wraps grandchildren (daily goals under weekly) with `GoalProvider`
- ✅ Removed `goal` and `onUpdateGoal` props from child component calls
- ✅ Child components (`WeeklyGoalTaskItem`, `DailyGoalTaskItem`) now get goal from context

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility Pattern

All migrated components follow this pattern:

```tsx
// Prefer goal from context, fall back to prop during migration
const contextGoal = useOptionalGoalContext();
const goal = contextGoal?.goal ?? goalProp;

if (!goal) {
  throw new Error(
    "Component must be used within GoalProvider or receive goal prop"
  );
}
```

### Provider Wrapping Strategy

Components that may be entry points wrap their content:

```tsx
const content = <ActualComponent />;

// If goal came from prop (backward compat), wrap with GoalProvider
// Otherwise, assume we're already in a GoalProvider
return contextGoal ? (
  content
) : (
  <GoalProvider goal={goal}>{content}</GoalProvider>
);
```

## Validation

- ✅ All Phase A files pass TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Zero linter errors
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained - no breaking changes
- ✅ Goal data flows through context in all Phase A components

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Eliminated prop drilling** in 6 high-traffic components
2. **Consistent pattern** for goal data access via context
3. **Zero breaking changes** - all components support both patterns during migration
4. **Foundation laid** for Phase B and C migrations
5. **Better developer experience** - components no longer need to pass `goal` prop through multiple layers

## Next Steps (Phase B & C)

Phase A focused on the goal-details system. Future phases will migrate:

- **Phase B:** Organisms that orchestrate lists (`WeekCardDailyGoals`, `WeekCardWeeklyGoals`, `FocusModeDailyViewDailyGoals`, `QuarterlyGoal`, `DayContainer`)
- **Phase C:** Quarterly summary components and ancillary atoms using `goalId`

## Files Modified in Phase A

1. ✅ `apps/webapp/src/contexts/GoalContext.tsx` (created)
2. ✅ `apps/webapp/src/components/organisms/DailyGoalTaskItem.tsx`
3. ✅ `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/day-of-week/components/WeeklyGoalTaskItem.tsx`
4. ✅ `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/goal-details/GoalDetailsPopover.tsx`
5. ✅ `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/goal-details/GoalDetailsFullScreenModal.tsx`
6. ✅ `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/goal-details/GoalActionMenu.tsx`
7. ✅ `apps/webapp/src/components/molecules/goal-details/GoalDetailsChildrenList.tsx`

**Total: 7 files (1 created, 6 migrated)**
