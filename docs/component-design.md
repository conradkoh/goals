## High-Level Components Design and Approach

This document outlines our high-level approach to creating reusable UI components that are consistently styled and behaviorally consistent across the Goals Tracking Application. All components will be built using and extending components from the Shadcn UI library to ensure a uniform look and feel.

### Overview

- **Reusability and Consistency:**
  We will create a set of reusable components that can be shared across different screens (Quarter Overview, Weekly Focus, Daily Tasks) to improve code maintainability and ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Shadcn UI Foundation:**
  All components are built using primitives provided by the Shadcn UI library. Customizations will be applied on top of these components to meet our specific application requirements (e.g., keyboard shortcuts, rich text support).

- **Scalability:**
  The design focuses on modularity, allowing new components to be easily added or modified as the application grows.

### Reusable Components List

1. **Confirmation Dialogs**
   - Purpose: To confirm critical user actions (e.g., deletion, irreversible changes).
   - Approach: Use the Dialog component from Shadcn UI, ensuring a consistent modal design with adaptive behavior (responsive, accessible, and keyboard-navigable).
2. **Rich Text Editors**

   - Purpose: To provide consistent text editing experiences within goal descriptions, task details, and other rich text areas.
   - Approach: Build on Shadcn UI's input and popover components to create an editor that supports features like hyperlink embedding (Cmd+K).
   - Note: Ensure that cut and paste operations maintain rich formatting and hyperlinks as per user requirements.

3. **Notification Toasts**

   - Purpose: To display transient messages for success, error, or informational feedback.
   - Approach: Use the Toast component from Shadcn UI for a unified experience across the application.

4. **Dropdown Menus and Context Menus**

   - Purpose: For quick actions such as editing, deleting, or navigating to details pages related to goals or tasks.
   - Approach: Utilize the Menu components from Shadcn UI to create contextual menus that are accessible and responsive.

5. **Global Modals and Overlays**
   - Purpose: To handle various global interactions such as linking resources, detailed editing, or multi-step confirmations.
   - Approach: Built using the Dialog components, these modals will be highly configurable to support different workflows while keeping a unified style.

### Design Considerations

- **Accessibility:**
  All components will be designed with accessibility in mind, including keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and responsive design.

- **Customization and Theming:**
  We will leverage Shadcn UI's theming capabilities to ensure our components can adapt to application-specific themes and branding.

- **Consistency Across Interactions:**
  Interactions such as hover states, focus outlines, and transition animations will adhere to a consistent design language to provide a smooth user experience.

### Next Steps

With this high-level design in place, we can proceed to create concrete examples and implementation details for each component. The next phase will involve prototyping these components, starting with the Confirmation Dialog and Rich Text Editor, to validate our approach and iterate on design as needed.
