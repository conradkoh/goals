# Pulling Goals

The Goals app provides functionality to help you manage and move incomplete tasks between different time periods. This helps you maintain continuity in your task management and ensures no important tasks are left behind.

## Pulling from Previous Day

You can pull incomplete tasks from the previous day to the current day. This is useful when you have tasks that you didn't complete and want to move them forward.

### How It Works

1. Click on the day header (e.g., "Tuesday", "Wednesday") to open the day menu
2. Select "Pull Incomplete" from the menu
3. All incomplete tasks from the previous day will be moved to the current day

### Limitations

- You cannot pull tasks to Monday since it's the first day of the week
- Tasks can only be pulled from the immediately previous day
- Only incomplete tasks will be moved; completed tasks remain in their original day

### Tips

- Use this feature at the start of your day to bring forward any unfinished tasks
- Tasks maintain their association with their weekly and quarterly goals when moved
- The original task is moved (not copied), maintaining a single source of truth

## Coming Soon: Pulling from Previous Week

> This section describes functionality that will be available in a future update.

The ability to pull tasks from the previous week will provide more flexibility in managing tasks across longer time periods.
