# Converting the PRD to a design

The design doc should have the following

1. Screens - the pages that the user will see
2. Sections - the sections of the page
3. Components - the components that are used in the sections
4. User interactions for each component

For each section of the design doc, you should link it back to the PRD.

Look at the project structure and find the design file, and update the content there.
