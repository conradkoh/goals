# Feature: Documents Management

## Summary

Add the ability for users to create, view, and search documents within the Goals application. Documents serve as a supporting artifact that can be referenced alongside goals and tasks.

## Goals

1. Allow users to create rich-text documents with titles and content
2. Provide a way to browse and search existing documents
3. Enable linking documents to goals (optional future enhancement)
4. Keep the feature lightweight and integrated with the existing UI patterns

## Non-Goals

1. Full-featured document editor (Google Docs replacement)
2. Real-time collaborative editing
3. Document versioning/history
4. File attachments/uploads
5. Folder/hierarchy organization (keep flat structure for MVP)
