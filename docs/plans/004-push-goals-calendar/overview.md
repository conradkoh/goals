# Feature: Push Goals Back via Calendar

## Summary

Enhance the goal rescheduling experience by providing a calendar-based interface for moving goals to different weeks or days. Currently, users can move goals using dropdown selects; this feature adds a visual calendar picker for more intuitive date selection.

## Goals

1. Allow users to visually select target dates using a calendar
2. Improve UX for rescheduling weekly and daily goals
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing move goal infrastructure
4. Support both week selection and day selection

## Non-Goals

1. Drag-and-drop calendar view (too complex for MVP)
2. Changing the existing dropdown-based flow (calendar is an enhancement)
3. Moving quarterly goals (quarter constraints make calendar confusing)
4. Bulk goal rescheduling (single goal at a time for MVP)
